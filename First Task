First Task - Algorithm for Counting Words and Vowels in a Sentence:

    Initialize three counters: wordCount = 0, vowelCount = 0, and charCount = 0.
    Read the input sentence.
    Iterate through each character in the sentence (excluding the last character, which is the point).
        Increment the charCount by 1.
        If the current character is a space (' '), increment wordCount by 1.
        If the current character is a vowel (considering both uppercase and lowercase vowels), increment vowelCount by 1.
    After the loop ends, increment wordCount by 1 to account for the last word in the sentence.
    Print or return the values of wordCount and vowelCount.

Pseudocode:

Algorithm CountWordsAndVowels(sentence):
    wordCount = 0
    vowelCount = 0
    charCount = 0

    for i = 0 to length(sentence) - 2 do:
        charCount = charCount + 1
        
        if sentence[i] == ' ' then:
            wordCount = wordCount + 1
        
        if sentence[i] is a vowel (considering both uppercase and lowercase vowels) then:
            vowelCount = vowelCount + 1
    
    wordCount = wordCount + 1
    print "Number of words:", wordCount
    print "Number of vowels:", vowelCount
